### Always Separate Concerns:
- Routes define endpoints.
- Controllers contain business logic.
- Models interact with the database.

### How the App Ties Together

The above changes ensure that your application structure is modular and scalable:

- HTTP Requests: Handled by service1Routes.js.
- Business Logic: Processed by service1Controller.js.
- Database Interactions: Managed by service1Model.js.

By doing this, your app remains clean, organized, and easy to expand with additional services or APIs.

#### Here’s a breakdown of potential features for the Dashboard and Account sections, tailored to different user roles (e.g., public, logged-in, and admin users). The goal is to provide a flexible structure that can be expanded as your portal grows.

To build a navigation system that supports both public and private routes while being scalable for a large portal with multiple services and features, you can use a dynamic navigation bar. The design should:

Adapt to User Authentication: Dynamically show or hide options based on whether the user is logged in.
Support Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Show different menu items based on the user's role (e.g., admin, regular user, guest).
Be Modular and Scalable: Allow easy addition of new sections or services without rewriting core navigation logic.
Suggested Navigation Structure
Here’s a sample structure that includes public routes, private routes, and placeholders for scalability:

1. Public Routes
Home: Always accessible.
About: Information about the portal or organization.
Services: Showcase public services.
Blog/Posts: Accessible to everyone, but some articles can be restricted to logged-in users.
Login: A call to action for users to sign in or register.
2. Private Routes
Dashboard: Personalized user homepage.
Account Settings: Manage profile, preferences, etc.
Admin Panel: For super admins to manage users, services, or content.
Subscriptions: For managing paid tiers, if applicable.


Dashboard
The Dashboard should act as the user's personalized control panel, presenting relevant information and quick access to actions based on their role.
